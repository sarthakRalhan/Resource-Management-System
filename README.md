# Resource-Management-System
OBJECTIVE:
1. To maintain an application that
handles the equipment needs of
farmers and maintains data of total
number of resources, allocated
resources, customers using banker’s
algorithm.
2. To provide a sequence which satisfies
farmers needs in the best way
possible.
3. To provide feasible solutions so that
we can satisfy everyone’s needs by
deadlock removal.
Banker’s algorithm is named so because it
is used in banking system to check
whether loan can be sanctioned to a
person or not. Suppose there are n
number of account holders in a bank and
the total sum of their money is S. If a
person applies for a loan then the bank
first subtracts the loan amount from the
total money that bank has and if the
remaining amount is greater than S then
only the loan is sanctioned. It is done
because if all the account holders comes
to withdraw their money then the bank
can easily do it.
In other words, the bank would never
allocate its money in such a way that it
can no longer satisfy the needs of all its
customers. The bank would try to be in
safe state always.
